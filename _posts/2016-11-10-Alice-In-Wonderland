title: Alice in Wonderland

Crazy? I've been called that before,
Black and white, my world of monotony.
Sad? I've always been dreaming of more,
A world down the hole, an escape from daily agony.
Colours hit me, eyes widen at this change,
Sizes distorted, what is this fantasy land?
Seems like a giant's garden, eh, pretty strange,
All here determined by the Queen's short-tempered hand.
Crazy? I've identified as that before,
But here, the Hatter confuses and takes the lead.
Mad? There's hidden potential still, so much more
Amused curiosity at this, the Cheshire grins in my head.
