title: Tapping into your Chakras
---

I feel your gaze, what do you see?

What I show, or who I be?

Sometimes, this world is too small,

When I uncurl, I find myself too tall.

They say thereâ€™s much more to you,

More places you live in, at least a few.

Always wondered - made of conflict, am I?

My pieces born separately, I can no longer deny.

Overlapping worlds, intersecting energy fields,

Unknown potential, made inaccessible by my shields.

Breathe in, open up - take down these fences,

I belong everywhere, pure spirit and senses.
